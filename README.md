## :rocket: Local Development

Start developing locally.

Before you get started make sure you sign up for these service providers

- http://auth0.com (for Authentication)
- https://cloudinary.com (for image uploads, optional)

#### Step-1

clone this repo

```sh
https://github.com/anuraghazra/convoychat.git
```

#### Step-2

Install all dependencies

```sh
# install server side deps
cd convoychat
npm install

# install client side deps
cd client
npm install
```

#### Step-3

Environment variables

_Now this is a bit tricky._

- create a new file .env in the root folder
- open [.env.EXAMPLE](./.env.EXAMPLE)
- copy the contents and paste it to the .env

And change all the dummy keys with your own valid ones.

#### Step-3.1 : Setup Auth0

Most importantly you'll need Auth0

Follow this guide -

> https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/webapp/nodejs

Also it is important that you setup all the callback URLs correctly in Auth0 Dashboard.

(You can open an [issue](https://github.com/anuraghazra/convoychat/issues) or contact me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/anuraghazru) if you get stuck)

#### Step-3.2 : Setup Cloudinary (Optional)

If you are working on a feature which includes image uploads you'll also need to setup cloudinary

Follow this guide -

> https://cloudinary.com/documentation/how_to_integrate_cloudinary

Also it is important that you setup all the callback URLs correctly in Auth0 Dashboard.

#### Step-4: Starting the server

Finally to start the server execute this script

```sh
npm run develop
```

#### All Package.json scripts

- Main Dev scripts
  - **dev:tsc** - Compiles typescript code
  - **dev:server** - Runs and watches server for file changes
  - **dev:client** - Runs the client side
  - **develop** - Starts the app, runs dev:tsc, dev:server- dev:client at once
- Tests
